We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation.

The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL. Knowledge of web frameworks (e.g., React) is a plus. Excellent quantitative, analytical, and communication skills; past experience working with mathematicians, scientists, or journalists is valuable. Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) are a requirement. We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL. Knowledge of web frameworks (e.g., React) is a plus. Excellent quantitative, analytical, and communication skills; past experience working with mathematicians, scientists, or journalists is valuable. Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) are a requirement. We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation.

The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL. Knowledge of web frameworks (e.g., React) is a plus. Excellent quantitative, analytical, and communication skills; past experience working with mathematicians, scientists, or journalists is valuable. Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) are a requirement. We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL.

Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) are a requirement. We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

What You'll Do
Have you ever dreamt of joining a highly skilled team to build a groundbreaking product with a start-up spirit, yet the power of the top networking company in the world? This is the mission of our team. We are actively hiring highly skilled engineers, with a true passion for innovation. Our mission is to develop a new generation of routing engine for the Internet deeply using Data Analytics, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The size, diversity, and richness of our data are simply unmatched. The Internet is changing fast, and we are too. The objective of this confidential product is to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications.
You will have a multi-faceted role, which covers data understanding and storytelling via visual analytics: You thrive in a dynamic environment that requires a rare blend of innovation and speed of execution. You are highly skilled in the trifecta for data visualization: visualization, statistical analysis and storytelling. You love playing with data and finding patterns that tell excellent data stories. You are skilled at extracting insights by applying visualization and statistical techniques from sophisticated, large and diverse datasets. You will research, build and deploy visualization frameworks for large datasets. You pride yourself on your communication and interpersonal skills, a keen eye for both aesthetic design and code. You have an ability to autonomously plan and organize your work assignments based on the objectives of the team. Who You'll Work With
Our team is made of engineers with a very diverse skillset united by their passion and the excitement of turning innovative ideas into products that impact the industry at large.
We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We love designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines. Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Go as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL and the Hadoop ecosystem. Who You Are
An agile, pragmatic, and hardworking engineer with experience in providing simple and intuitive visualization of sophisticated and intricate datasets. You love technology, innovation, and building products at scale.
You hold a degree in Computer Science or a related field with at least 6 years of experience. You can demonstrate a large portfolio of beautiful, intuitive, and interactive infographics that demonstrates your key strengths: Broad experience in turning diverse and sophisticated data into meaningful visualization. Attention to detail and an eye for aesthetic design. Experienced in Javascript (ES6) and data visualization technologies such as D3.js, Canvas, or WebGL. Knowledge of web frameworks (e.g., React) is a plus. Excellent quantitative, analytical, and communication skills; past experience working with mathematicians, scientists, or journalists is valuable. Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) are a requirement. We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",10000+ Employees
